# hello-world
This is me learning how to use github as I'm learning to write code.

I'm a teacher right now, but I'm interested in learning to code so that I can do some freelance work.  I've always enjoyed programming, although I have not done much of it to date. I've dabbled in several languages, but have not yet become proficient in anything too marketable.  So that's why I'm looking to learn more, and am enrolled at freecodecamp.org.
